# 👋 Hey! I'm Marion

🌱 Full stack developer in the making at **La Capsule**   
💻 Currently building with: `React`, `Node`, `Express`, `MongoDB`... but always curious to explore more.  
🎨 I code by day and craft by heart: **pottery, embroidery**, and all kinds of handmade creations.  
🧩 I love figuring out how things work and finding simple solutions to complex problems.  
🌍 I'm drawn to **meaningful, responsible projects** — especially those with a positive impact on the **climate**.
